# Maven-Market
😆 This is my third project on Power BI as part of my learning journey. 

⭐ The data is sourced from the Udemy course 'Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence (2023)' instructed by Marven Analytics, Chris Dutton, and Aarron Parry.

💬 The analysis is conducted for Maven Market, a cross-border grocery chain operating in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

🎁 Some of the course's key learnings included:

- Creating data models, understanding concepts such as table relationships, star & snowflake schema, relationship cardinality and how to conect multiple fact tables. 

- I gained hands-on experience in creating calculated formulas and measures using DAX syntax. 

- The course also provided valuable insights into advanced visualization techniques, such as applying drillthrough filters, building bookmarks and slicer panels, and creating field parameters for dynamic exploration of different metrics.

- However, I must admit that what truly fascinated me was the application of custom tooltips! The ability to deliver a wealth of information in the most efficient way is truly remarkable.
